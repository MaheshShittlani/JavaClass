Input / Output in java (java.io.*)
--------------------------------------
	In java input/ output is performed through streams

What is stream
------------------
	Source or Destination
		Input Stream
		Output Stream
Types of Streams
-------------------
	1. Byte Stream
		Read and Write data 1 byte at a time. It is used to deal with
		binary data as it is saved in memory.
		No conversion is happening while reading and writing data from
		stream to memory.
	2. Character Stream
		It is used to read / Write data in character format, 1 character
		at a time but in background data is stored in binary so character
		stream is connected with binary stream to read / write binary
		data and convert them into character.
		So here the conversion from binary to character and character to 
		binary is happening in background.
	
Input/Output Byte Stream class hierarchy
----------------------------------
Object
-	InputStream(A)
		FileInputStream
		FilterInputStream
					DataInputStream
					BufferedInputStream
		ObjectInputStream
-	OutputStream(A)
		FileOutputStream
		FilterOutputStream
					DataOutputStream
					BufferedOutputStream
		ObjectOutputStream
		
----------------------------------------
java.io.InputStream(A) Methods
	- int read(): Read one byte and return int version, return -1 for EOF
	- int read(byte[] b): Read one byte and put it into array `b` and 
						program reads data from array, Return how many 
						bytes are successfully read.
	- int read(byte[], int off, int len)
	- void close()
	- long skip(long n)

java.io.OutputStream(A) Methods
	- int write()
	- int write(byte[])
	- int write(byte[], int off, int len)
	- void close()
	- void flush()
---------------------------------

FileInputStream/ FileOutputStream
	-Used to read and write from or to a file.
	
FileInputStream
----------------------
	-FileInputStream(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException
	-FileInputStream(File file)
	
FileOutputStream
-----------------------
	- FileOutputStream(String filename)
	- FileOutputStream(File file)
	- FileOutputStream(String filename, boolean append)
	- FileOutputStream(File file, boolean append)
	
-DataInputStream / DataOutputStream
	- Usage
	- Exercise Question: Write roll no, names and score in a file
						Read back the data from file and display.
				
	- Exercise Question: DetectEndOfFile
		-Filter Even/Odd from numbers.dat file
		
-BufferedInputStream / BufferedOutputStream
	- BufferedInputStream(InputStream in) // 512 bytes of buffer
	- BufferedInputStream(InputStream in, int bufferSize)
	- BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out)
	- BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream out, int bufferSize)
	
Exercise: CopyFile
